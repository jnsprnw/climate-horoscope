    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-prose leading-relaxed">Since the beginning of mankind, humans have been looking to the night sky, for reasons as numerous as the stars themselves. Comfort, wonder, a sense of belonging, a sense of futility, guidance, be it in the navigational or the metaphorical sense, the night sky has it all. The systems for translating the movement of the stars into advice, into recommendations, into glimpses of the future, are just as abundant. We yearn to read the stars, especially in times of uncertainty.</p>

    <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-prose leading-relaxed">Long before we were here, the stars have sent their light and radiation, their gravitational waves, into the ever-growing expanse that is the observable universe. And long after our strange species of evolved apes has vanished, they will continue to do so. Regardless of whether we are there to witness them. We, that for a brief moment in cosmic history, have taken such a keen interest in them.</p>
      
      <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-prose leading-relaxed">How long will that moment be? It is up to us as a species. Anthropogenic climate change threatens to cut our cosmic story shorter than it has to be. With this app, we propose a simple refocus. Yes, the stars and constellations, the moon and the sun, the black holes and neighboring planets may affect our lives, but we need not look that far. Our immediate surroundings, our regional climate, will have a far larger effect on all of our lives. To make this visible, we have created climate fortunes.</p>
      
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 max-w-prose leading-relaxed">Drawing on the concepts of astrology and fueled by real climate science, we offer personal climate fortunes. To offer a glimpse of the future that is more certain than we would like it to be. Let us focus on our planet right now, so future generations can enjoy our planet earth. It is, after all, the only known observatory in the universe.</p>
