# Climateâ€”Fortunes

Welcome to your Climate Horoscope, where we navigate the turbulent skies of a world affected by climate change. Let us delve into the atmospheric energies that will shape your day and shed light on the evolving weather patterns around us in times of the climate crisis.

## About
Since the beginning of mankind, humans have been looking to the night sky, for reasons as numerous as the stars themselves. Comfort, wonder, a sense of belonging, a sense of futility, guidance, be it in the navigational or the metaphorical sense, the night sky has it all. The systems for translating the movement of the stars into advice, into recommendations, into glimpses of the future, are just as abundant. We yearn to read the stars, especially in times of uncertainty.

Long before we were here, the stars have sent their light and radiation, their gravitational waves, into the ever-growing expanse that is the observable universe. And long after our strange species of evolved apes has vanished, they will continue to do so. Regardless of whether we are there to witness them. We, that for a brief moment in cosmic history, have taken such a keen interest in them.

How long will that moment be? It is up to us as a species. Anthropogenic climate change threatens to cut our cosmic story shorter than it has to be. With this app, we propose a simple refocus. Yes, the stars and constellations, the moon and the sun, the black holes and neighboring planets may affect our lives, but we need not look that far. Our immediate surroundings, our regional climate, will have a far larger effect on all of our lives. To make this visible, we have created climate fortunes.

Drawing on the concepts of astrology and fueled by real climate science, we offer personal climate fortunes. To offer a glimpse of the future that is more certain than we would like it to be. Let us focus on our planet right now, so future generations can enjoy our planet earth. It is, after all, the only known observatory in the universe.

## Background

Developed during the Environmental Data, Media and the Humanities-Hackathon, 31 May - 2 June 2023, Potsdam, organised by the network of digital humanities of Potsdam University in collaboration with Lukas Diestel, Maximilian Hepach, Giacomo Marinsalta, Sybille Neumeyer, Jonas Parnow, Birgit Schneider, May Ee Wong, funded by the Alexander von Humboldt Foundation.


## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
